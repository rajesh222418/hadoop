Most of people usually create their MapReduce job using a driver code that is executed though its static main method. The downside of such implementation is that most of your specific configuration (if any) is usually hardcoded. Should you need to modify some of your configuration properties on the fly (such as changing the number of reducers), you would have to modify your code, rebuild your jar file and redeploy your application. This can be avoided by implementing the Tool interface in your MapReduce driver code.
